# Where's that Brace!?
This is a program that lexicalizes a C like program and determines where the missing complementary brace of "{(\[" or "\])}" is.
Much of this code has been repurposed from my earlier projects.

```bash 
wheres-that-brace [options]:
  -h [ --help ]         Output this help message
  -f [ --file ] arg     The the file's path that is to be checked
```

Will only output on error.
